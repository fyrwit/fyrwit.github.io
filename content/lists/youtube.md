I recently caught up with a good friend who I hadn't talked to in a long time. We share many common interests, but at some point he mentioned that he hardly watches YouTube. This is something I do a great deal of so I decided to create this list for him and others who may not be so fixated as I.

YouTube is where I spend much of my non-work, internet time. I have a very long subscription list and I tend to watch videos from them as they are published, rather than watching what ever the algorythm serves me. Though of course I do watch its recommended videos, and sometimes it serves bangers. I am always eager to find new goodness, so please drop me a line if you have any recommendations or would like to critique my taste. 

Each title is a link to the channel. I recommend looking at their vidoes and filtering by popularity to start. I have included a video that is either my favourite or what I feel to be the best representation of the channel. I will use footnote [^kids] to indicate channels that I think would be good for kids. 

## Top Tier
These are creators that I hold in highest regard. I will watch any video that they publish as soon as I can.

### [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/@AppliedScience/videos)
Very detailed videos on things that you wouldn't expect someone to be able to do in their garage. Ben does a good job of explaining things, and his tutorials are very good.
{{< youtube j-FHbHoiwNk>}} 

### [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould/videos "Steve Mould") [^kids] 
Persistent curiosity about the physical world combined with humour.  
{{< youtube SqhXQUzVMlQ >}}

### [Bobby Fingers](https://www.youtube.com/@bobbyfingers/videos)
Like looking over the shoulder of a multi-medium artistic and comedic genius. Worth watching in order, but if you want to go straight to peak Fingers then watch the Bezos head boat video below. I should also mention that coincidentally this is not the first time I've encountered Rob McGlynn's rather enigmatic work[^bandits].

### [Breaking Taps](https://www.youtube.com/@BreakingTaps/videos)
Similar vibes to Applied Science above. Really great videos on a broad variety of topics, all of which seem beyound the reach of someone in their home shop. As with many on this list, Zach is clearly a very smart and curious person.

### [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/@smartereveryday/videos)
Destin shares his excitement for the world and how it works along with his respect and appreciation of people - especially blue collar or people he feels are under-appreciated or under-estimated.
{{< youtube EVbdbVhzcM4 >}}

### [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/videos)
An exploration of mathematics and physics with exceptional animations produced with an Manim, an animation scripting library developed Grant Sanderson.
{{< youtube EmKQsSDlaa4 >}}

### [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere/videos) [^kids]
Application of mechanical and software engineering to solve problems that don't really need a solution.
{{< youtube aXfTgCCsRSg >}}

### [Clickspring](https://www.youtube.com/@Clickspring/videos)
Chris has been making extremely detailed, 'from scratch' watch and clockmaking videos for many years. In recent years he has been focusing on reproducing the Antikythera mechanism. Not only is he reproducing the mechanism, but he is also practicing 'experimental archeology' by using techniques that would have been available at the time to make the parts. This video is my favourite because it shows how one can go from simple materials to quite precise pieces - essentially bootstrapping precision manufacturing.
{{< youtube 4pK3O43Jddg >}}

### [Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/@WelchLabsVideo/videos)
Thoughtful and often well animated, contemporary and historic, math and science explainers.
{{< youtube d3mHfqd0VZY >}}

### [Chemistorian](https://www.youtube.com/@Chemistorian/videos)
The history of how we know things. The video on how the noble gasses were discovered is my favourite and merits a place in the top tier.
{{< youtube loqudG71uBM >}}

### [Dan Gelbart](https://www.youtube.com/@dgelbart/videos)
Deep dive videos into mechanical prototyping and manufacturing methods and novel mechanisms. I recommend his 18 video series on building prototypes to anyone doing such an activity. I especially appreciate his words at the end of the last video: "If something is 100% functional it is always beautiful".
{{< youtube xMP_AfiNlX4 >}}

### [This Old Tony](https://www.youtube.com/@ThisOldTony/videos)
Lighthearted and humorous exploration of mechanining, welding, and various other mechanical acivities that someone could pursue in their garage or shed
{{< youtube jM2_LBvzg6c >}}

### [engineerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerguyvideo/videos) [^kids]
To-the-point exploration of examples of exceptional engineering.
{{< youtube hUhisi2FBuw >}}

[^kids]: These are are good options for kids

## Calming
So calming that I use them as my soundtrack to fall asleep. I want to be clear here that I am not calling these channels boring. I enjoy the content and level of detail, and I am grateful that they exist. They hold my attention enough that my mind does not wander to stressful topics, but not so much that sleep is delayed. Probably a bad habit.

### [Asianometry](https://www.youtube.com/@Asianometry/videos)
Jon follows his curiosity through history, technology, and history of technology. These are essentially video essays, not dissimilar to podcasts. The visuals are interesting but not required. I find his videos excellent to fall asleep to, but I will often listen to them multiple of times, starting later each time, so that eventually I listen through the whole thing.
{{< youtube UEmlOjKmL68 >}}

### [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections/videos)
Intensely detailed breakdown of different household technologies, often with highly rationalized arguments for why, or the right way, to use them. Interesting, and great for things like learning how to use your dishwasher correctly, but in this category because the videos are always so dang long.
{{< youtube jHP942Livy0 >}}

### [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile/videos)
Tutorials from researchers and instructors on concepts and developments in computer science. Perhaps not the right category for them but I have used the mas a sleep aid in the past.
