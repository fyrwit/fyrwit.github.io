v1.0

I recently caught up with a good friend who shares many common interests with me. At some point he mentioned that he hardly watches YouTube. This is something I do a great deal of, so I decided to create this list for him and others who may not be so exposed to the 'tube.

YouTube is where I spend much of my non-work, internet time. I have a very long subscription list - below is just a sampling. I tend to watch videos from my subscriptions as they are published, rather than watching what ever the algorithm serves me. Though sometimes it serves bangers. I am always eager to find new goodness, so please drop me a line if you have any recommendations or would like to critique my taste. 

Each title is a link to the channel. I recommend looking at their videos and filtering by popularity to start. I have included a video that is either my favorite or what I feel to be the best representation of the channel. I will use footnote [^kids] to indicate channels that I think would be good for kids. 

## Top Tier
These are creators that I hold in highest regard. I will watch any video that they publish as soon as I can.

### [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/@AppliedScience/videos)
Very detailed videos on things that you wouldn't expect someone to be able to do in their garage. Ben does a good job of explaining things, and his tutorials are very good.
{{< youtube j-FHbHoiwNk>}} 

### [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould/videos "Steve Mould") [^kids] 
Persistent curiosity about the physical world combined with humour.  
{{< youtube SqhXQUzVMlQ >}}

### [Bobby Fingers](https://www.youtube.com/@bobbyfingers/videos)
Like looking over the shoulder of a multi-medium artistic and comedic genius. Worth watching in order, but if you want to go straight to peak Fingers then watch the Bezos head boat video below. I should also mention that coincidentally this is not the first time I've encountered Rob McGlynn's rather enigmatic work[^bandits].
{{< youtube VGhcSupkNs8>}}

### [Breaking Taps](https://www.youtube.com/@BreakingTaps/videos)
Similar vibes to Applied Science above. Really great videos on a broad variety of topics, all of which seem beyound the reach of someone in their home shop. As with many on this list, Zach is clearly a very smart and curious person.
{{< youtube RuVS7MsQk4Y >}}

### [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/@smartereveryday/videos)
Destin shares his excitement for the world and how it works along with his respect and appreciation of people - especially blue collar or people he feels are under-appreciated or under-estimated.
{{< youtube EVbdbVhzcM4 >}}

### [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/videos)
An exploration of mathematics and physics with exceptional animations produced with an Manim, an animation scripting library developed Grant Sanderson.
{{< youtube EmKQsSDlaa4 >}}

### [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere/videos) [^kids]
Application of mechanical and software engineering to solve problems that don't really need a solution.
{{< youtube aXfTgCCsRSg >}}

### [Clickspring](https://www.youtube.com/@Clickspring/videos)
Chris has been making extremely detailed, 'from scratch' watch and clock making videos for many years. In recent years he has been focusing on reproducing the Antikythera mechanism. Not only is he reproducing the mechanism, but he is also practicing 'experimental archeology' by using techniques that would have been available at the time to make the parts. This video is my favorite because it shows how one can go from simple materials to quite precise pieces - essentially bootstrapping precision manufacturing.
{{< youtube 4pK3O43Jddg >}}

### [Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/@WelchLabsVideo/videos)
Thoughtful and often well animated, contemporary and historic, math and science explainers.
{{< youtube d3mHfqd0VZY >}}

### [Chemistorian](https://www.youtube.com/@Chemistorian/videos)
The history of how we know things. The video on how the noble gasses were discovered is my favorite and merits a place in the top tier.
{{< youtube loqudG71uBM >}}

### [This Old Tony](https://www.youtube.com/@ThisOldTony/videos)
Lighthearted and humorous exploration of machining, welding, and various other mechanical activities that someone could pursue in their garage or shed
{{< youtube jM2_LBvzg6c >}}

### [engineerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerguyvideo/videos) [^kids]
To-the-point exploration of examples of exceptional engineering.
{{< youtube hUhisi2FBuw >}}

[^kids]: These are good options for kids
[^bandits]: [Horse Outside by The Rubberbandits](https://youtu.be/ljPFZrRD3J8?si=RIoQPF5TNleA25YD)

## Calming
So calming that I use them as my soundtrack to fall asleep. I want to be clear here that I am not calling these channels boring. I enjoy the content and level of detail, and I am grateful that they exist. They hold my attention enough that my mind does not wander to stressful topics, but not so much that sleep is delayed. Probably a bad habit.

### [Asianometry](https://www.youtube.com/@Asianometry/videos)
Jon follows his curiosity through history, technology, and history of technology. These are essentially video essays, not dissimilar to podcasts. The visuals are interesting but not required. I find his videos excellent to fall asleep to, but I will often listen to them multiple of times, starting later each time, so that eventually I listen through the whole video.
{{< youtube UEmlOjKmL68 >}}

### [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections/videos)
Intensely detailed breakdown of different household technologies, often with highly rationalized arguments for why, or the right way, to use them. Interesting, and great for things like learning how to use your dishwasher correctly, but in this category because the videos are always so dang long.
{{< youtube jHP942Livy0 >}}

### [Horses](https://www.youtube.com/@HorsesOnYT/videos)
Unusual and often very interesting video essays. Sometimes not calming.
{{< youtube 5DDVmP4935E >}}

## General Interest
Good wholesome watchin'

### [AlphaPhoenix](https://www.youtube.com/@AlphaPhoenixChannel/videos)
Exploration of physical phenomena.
{{< youtube 8i9WMD6xbuA >}}

### [Stand-up Maths](https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths/videos)
Wry explorations of interesting and sometimes mundane mathematics. 
{{< youtube Vv-lWg5HNaM >}}

### [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium/videos)
At over 18 million subscribers it's hard to imagine someone on the internet not coming across one of Derek's videos at some point. Usually interesting, though sometimes a little too 'popular'.
{{< youtube AF8d72mA41M >}}

### [MinuteEarth](https://www.youtube.com/@MinuteEarth/videos) [^kids]
Short videos about the natural world.
{{< youtube CHTMZiXeB6A >}}

### [MinuteFood](https://www.youtube.com/@MinuteFood/videos) [^kids]
Short videos about the science of food, cooking, and cooking tools.
{{< youtube fljZ_jaUq-c >}}

### [MinutePhysics](https://www.youtube.com/@MinutePhysics/videos)
(Usually) short videos about physics.
{{< youtube zcqZHYo7ONs >}}

### [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey/videos)
Usually a well rationalized argument for why something is the best, often with commentary on why what we do, or some common instance of something, isn't.
{{< youtube thOifuHs6eY >}}

### [Kurzgesagt - In A Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt/featured) [^kids]
Animated videos about current scientific knowledge and speculative futures or scales. 
{{< youtube 1AElONvi9WQ >}} 

### [Jeremy Fielding](https://www.youtube.com/@Jeremy_Fielding/videos) [^fatherhood]
Electromechanical engineering projects and explainers. Jeremy is a very thoughtful and curious person - [this video](https://youtu.be/fYlwgd4Dw0E?si=USjk_OA3xBvBknlN) is not representative of all his videos, but it demonstrates this.
{{< youtube AlsCUzCCc-k >}}

### [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezAlt/videos)
Kenji's exploration of food science and art is prolific. 
I recommend following his method for salting scrambled eggs.
{{< youtube SZ6L1PVRjIk >}}

### [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile/videos)
Explanations of mathematics by practitioners. I especially recommend the Tadashi Tokieda playlist.
{{< youtube wYDh5d9pfu8 >}}

### [Nile Red](https://www.youtube.com/@NileRed/videos)
Exploration of chemistry through experimentation and practical demonstrations. His alternate channel, [Nile Blue](https://www.youtube.com/@NileBlue/videos), has some more "extreme" experiments.
{{< youtube d6Pcp944sRI >}} 

[^fatherhood]: Bonus from Jeremy: [Fatherhood Engineered](https://www.youtube.com/@fatherhoodengineered/videos)

## Essoterics
These are more niche or more for information than entertainment. I enjoy them, but in a way you need to have some context or reason to want to learn what they're teaching.

### [Dan Gelbart](https://www.youtube.com/@dgelbart/videos)
Deep dive videos into mechanical prototyping and manufacturing methods and novel mechanisms. I recommend his 18 video series on building prototypes to anyone doing such an activity. I especially appreciate his words at the end of the last video: "If something is 100% functional it is always beautiful".
{{< youtube xMP_AfiNlX4 >}}

### [Huygens Optics](https://www.youtube.com/@HuygensOptics/videos)
Videos for "his fellow nerds", mainly focused on optics and lithography. I really enjoyed learning about glass ceramics from this video.
{{< youtube qi8jmEbWsxU >}}

### [Signal Ditch](https://www.youtube.com/@SignalDitch/videos)
I found Nick's channel while looking for information on technical glassblowing. His video on pressure swing adsorption oxygen generators, and the one he built, is inspiring. 
The thing that really stands out about his other videos is that he explains how he finds the obscure parts and information that he needs, often without even knowing what they are called when he first starts looking.
{{< youtube lB3hHk1_2V0 >}}

### [ElectrArc240](https://www.youtube.com/@electrarc240/videos) 
I found this channel while trying to learn more about power electronics. I really enjoy how he breaks things down practically into elements.
{{< youtube ElTTOsj3y-Q >}}

### [Mamlambo Fossils](https://www.youtube.com/@MamlamboFossils/videos) [^kids]
Amateur archeology from the coast of New Zealand.
{{< youtube eBc82mnlZBU >}}

### [RC Test Flight](https://www.youtube.com/@rctestflight/videos)
Exploration of different aeronautical and hydrodynamic designs through the lens of RC hobby hardware - though not all of his vehicles are controlled remotely...
{{< youtube Los3J4SiKVU >}}


## Infotainment

### [Ze Frank](https://www.youtube.com/@zefrank/videos)
A great deal of interesting information wedged between silly humor. This video on how beetles wings fold inside their elytra is fascinating.
{{< youtube spuO7OpS6zw >}}

### [GoodWork](https://www.youtube.com/@GoodWorkMB/videos)
Comedy with some journalism(?) mixed in.
{{< youtube KipDBa4bTl8 >}}

### [Casually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@CasuallyExplained/videos)
Deadpan, often sarcastic observations.
(In this video one learns ways to mitigate the risk of my humerus suffering spiral fracture while arm wrestling)
{{< youtube T-MpV8K7JnU >}}

### Wendover Productions 

## Makers
### [Scott Brown Carpentry](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottBrownCarpentry/videos)
Master of b-roll, this is the only channel I consistently watch with my partner. Mostly aspirational, but it's very interesting to learn the little tricks and tools that make someone a master builder.
{{< youtube xfELyt3UCE4 >}}

### [Inheretance Machining](https://www.youtube.com/@InheritanceMachining/videos)
Pretty videos of by a man on an unhinged mission to design and machine by purely manual, mechanical means.
{{< youtube 7am-ysvGD3s >}}
